//V3:execution with pipes & child pcs    //
//                                       //
//V4: support all built-ins              //
//                                       //
//V5: support heredoc & redirections     //
//---------------------------------------//

// Read a full line as raw input.
// Use fork() and execvp() to execute the input line as-is.
// Wait for the child process (waitpid).
// Exit command ends the shell.
// Should check for builtins commands if not, look for external commands ($PATH)

// need to duplicate the arguments (char **argv) before passing them to the child process 
//duplicating the arguments gives the child process its own isolated and safe copy of the command-line arguments. 
//  This prevents unintended side effects and memory issues between the parent and child processes, 
//  particularly crucial when execve() is about to replace the child's entire memory space.

//VALORACION TMP PARA EMPEZAR
//  For each external command in that list, you will:
// Fork a new child process.
// Set up redirections (using adapted setup_redir and redir_input/output).
// Execute the command using execve (similar to your execution function).
// In the parent, wait for that child (using wait_child). This generic, looped approach is what allows Minishell to handle N commands.

//Initially I received a string with the cmd, flags and args
//With the tree I tree node and envp
// void	execution(char	**nargv, char **const envp)
//V0 just executes single cmd
//WHat tokenzation did: char *argv[] = {"ls", "-l", "/home", NULL};
//argv[0] is command name

/*
*   Executes single external cmd
*   1. 0 elements in argv is cmd
*   2. Find absolut cmd path
*   3. Fork
*   4. Waitpit
*   5. Executes cmd
*/
/*
cmd_name
maybe in parser: node->u_data.cmd.cmd_type = get_cmd_type(node->u_data.cmd.argv[0]);
    BUILIN IDEAS

    - child process will check if is builtin to execute
    - if is builtin will find which is it
    - Will execute it accordingly
